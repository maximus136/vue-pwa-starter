# Vue PWA Starter

#### A starter kit for a PWA app in Vue.

The starter kit comes with:
- *[vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)* for state management
- *[localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage)* for offline storage

The build configuration is a modified version of the *[generator-fountain-vue](https://github.com/FountainJS/generator-fountain-vue)* from the good people at FountainJS.


#### Usage

- `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies.

##### Use NPM scripts

- `npm run build` to build your application in /dist
- `npm run serve` to launch a browser sync server on your source files
- `npm run serve:dist` to launch a server on your optimized application
- `npm run test` to launch unit tests
- `npm run lint` to check for lint errors.
- `npm run lint:fix` to check and fix auto-fixable lint errors.

The app also contains a small example for vuex usage.
